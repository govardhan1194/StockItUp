# Installing a Pulsar Cluster:

Please follow the official guide on installation of pulsar - Deploying a cluster on bare metal:

https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/2.4.2/deploy-bare-metal/


The best go-to support for pulsar is the official pulsar documentation. It may not directly give you a solution to a problem you are facing but it's all in there. Additionally, you can refer to the document - Setup Documentation in this path for reference which involves information on setting up a cluster on AWS services.
